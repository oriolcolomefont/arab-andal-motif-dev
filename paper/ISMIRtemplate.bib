   abstract = {() Here we present a computational approach to identifying melodic patterns in a dataset of 145 MusicXML scores with the aim of contributing to centonization theory in the Moroccan tradition of Arab-Andalusian Music-a theory in development by expert performer and researcher of this tradition, Amin Chaachoo. Central to his work is the definition of a set of characteristic patterns, or centos, for each t. ab', or melodic mode. We apply three methods: TF-IDF, Maximally General Distinctive Patterns (MGDP) and the Structure Induction Algorithm (SIA) to identify characteristic patterns at the level of t. ab'. A substantial number of the centos proposed by Chaachoo are identified and new melodic patterns are retrieved. A discussion with Chaachoo about the obtained results promoted the elicitation of other categories of recurrent patterns in the tradition different from the centos, contributing to a deeper musicological knowledge of the tradition.},

   abstract = {The Arab-Andalusian music is performed through nawab¯ at (plural of nawba), suites of instrumental and vocal pieces ordered according to their metrical pattern in a sequence of increasing tempo. This study presents for the first time in literature a system for automatic recognition of nawba for audio recordings of the Moroccan tradition of Arab-Andalusian music. The proposed approach relies on template matching applied to pitch distributions computed from audio recordings. The templates have been created using a data-driven approach, utilizing a score collection categorized into nawab¯ at. This methodology has been tested on a dataset of 58 hours of music: a set of 77 recordings in eleven nawab¯ at from the Arab-Andalusian corpus collected within the CompMusic project and stored in Dunya platform. An accuracy of 75% on the nawba recognition task is reported using Euclidean distance (L2) as distance metric in the template matching.},

   abstract = {[Invited talk at ISMIR 2005] I We stand at a moment of opportunity. It's an easy thing to say. We stood at a moment of opportunity around 1980, in terms of the relationship between music theory and psychology: each discipline had good reasons for being interested in the other-for psychologists because music is a complex, culturally embedded activity that is open to quantitative analysis, for music theorists because empirical methods allowed them to ground and develop work that until then had been basically speculative. The opportunity was realized and the result was a gain for both partners. A new subdiscipline developed, but strongly linked to its parent disciplines and with new insights and ways of working that fed back into both. Obviously I wouldn't be saying this if I didn't think there was a similar opportunity today for musicologists in relation to music information science. I'm choosing my words carefully because the interdisciplinary interface I'm talking about here is more complicated than the music theory/psychology one of the 1980s. On the music side I'm talking about musicology in the broad sense that includes theory, ethnomusicology, and the rest. On the information science side I'm talking about a range of empirical and computational work that draws on and feeds back into computer science, cognitive science, acoustic engineering and I don't know how many other subdiscipines. I don't know how far there can be said to be such a thing as a discrete discipline, or subdiscipline, of music information retrieval, but for the musicologist wanting to expand his or her ways of working it seems a more complex and to that extent daunting field than was the case of music theory/psychology twenty years ago. I hope that that music information scientists feel that there is an opportunity for them in a closer relationship with musicology; I'm sure that a closer relationship with music information science presents musicologists with an opportunity. The trouble is, we've been standing at this moment of opportunity for quite some time now. By the end of the last century a great deal of work had gone into developing a variety-a huge variety-of music-computational tools, and quite a number of studies making use of these tools had been published. Naturally enough, such studies, and I'm thinking for instance of the work of David Huron and his co-workers, were designed to illustrate the potential of the tools: that's to say their starting point was what the tools could do rather than a musicological problem crying out for solution. What we still don't have to any considerable extent is the mirror image, that is to say studies that are grounded in mainstream musicological problems and that make use of computational tools as simply one of the ways you do musicology. In fact the area of musicology from which you would most expect such a response, what on the continent is called systematic musicology, has only a marginal existence within the Anglo-American discipline; such empirical musicology as there is tends to go under the strange and misleading label 'music psychology'. The ball, in short, is firmly in the musicologists' court, and there's a danger that the opportunity will be missed. In this paper I shall discuss what I think are some of the factors inhibiting musicologists' engagement with information science-though this means I'll also be talking about what I think are some of the opportunities, because the inhibiting factors and the opportunities are},

abstract = {In the medieval Islamic territories of the Iberian Peninsula known as Al-Andalus a unique style of music was formed combining local practices with Arab sensibilities. After the fall of the last Andalusian kingdom, this classical repertoire has been preserved to the present in North African countries. The idiosyncrasies of this repertoire, which combines musical traits from Western and Eastern Mediterranean traditions in orchestral and choral settings, as well as instrumental and vocal solos, deserves an in depth musicological study, that can benefit from computational tools for corpus-driven research. On the other hand, the characteristics of this music poses interesting challenges to MIR methods and therefore offer new research opportunities to this field. To address these topics, we present here the first complete release of the corpus for the research of the Moroccan tradition of Arab-Andalusian music built in the framework of the CompMusic project. The corpus comprises three data collections, namely audio recordings, music scores and lyrics, as well as related annotations and metadata. We also present a series of Jupyter Notebooks for browsing and retrieving data from the corpus. Both the corpus and notebooks are completely open to the research community.},
